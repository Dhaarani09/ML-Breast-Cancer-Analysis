# Breast Cancer Analysis using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer data using machine learning techniques to aid in the diagnosis and classification of malignant and benign tumors. The goal is to build a predictive model that can help identify breast cancer cases based on features extracted from breast mass data.

## Project Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the dataset to understand patterns, correlations, and relationships between features.
- **Model Building**: Implementing and comparing multiple machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance through grid search and cross-validation.

## Datasets

The dataset used for this project is the **[Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)** dataset, which contains the following attributes:
- **ID**: Patient ID.
- **Diagnosis**: M = malignant, B = benign.
- **Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, etc.**: Various features of cell nuclei derived from images.
  
## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-analysis.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd breast-cancer-analysis
   ```
3. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the data**: 
   Run the script to clean and preprocess the dataset.
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. **Train the model**:
   Train the model using various algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the model**:
   Get the performance metrics of the trained models.
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

## Results

- Achieved a classification accuracy of **XX%** with the **[best-performing model]**.
- Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score results for each model are documented.
