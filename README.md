Breast Cancer Analysis using Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer data using machine learning techniques to aid in the diagnosis and classification of malignant and benign tumors. The goal is to build a predictive model that can help identify breast cancer cases based on features extracted from breast mass data.

Project Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the dataset to understand patterns, correlations, and relationships between features.
Model Building: Implementing and comparing multiple machine learning algorithms.
Model Evaluation: Using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

Datasets
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which contains the following attributes:

ID: Patient ID.
Diagnosis: M = malignant, B = benign.

Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd breast-cancer-analysis
Install required dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preprocess the data: Run the script to clean and preprocess the dataset.

bash
python preprocess.py
Train the model: Train the model using various algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.

bash
python train_model.py
Evaluate the model: Get the performance metrics of the trained models.

bash
python evaluate_model.py

Results
Achieved a classification accuracy of XX% with the [best-performing model].
Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score results for each model are documented.
